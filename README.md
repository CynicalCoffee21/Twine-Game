# Twine-Game "Dark Elf: Origins"
This text based story game, is essentially meant to be the background story for the DarkElfPlatformer game that is also posted on my Git Page.
The game is written in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
All of the art credit goes to my friend: Justice Brown.
The story and writting were done by myself and another friend: Darren Sander.
The formatting, stlying, and organization were done by me.
